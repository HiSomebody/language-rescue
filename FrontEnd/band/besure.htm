<strong>Paul:&nbsp</strong>I am falling through the sky<br>
I wonder why<br>
You are leavin’ me behind<br>
But I don’t mind<br><br>

And I don’t mind<br>
Everything’s always hard to find<br>
I do it’s true<br>
Wishing on a shooting star<br><br>

And before you fall in love<br>
Be sure to make sure it’s good enough<br>
Maybe some things never had to be <br>
This way<br><br>

Chasing dreams I see a light<br> 
It’s worth a fight<br>
Never meant to leave you hurt<br>
Of that I’m sure<br><br>

And I don’t mind<br>
Everything’s always hard to find<br>
I do it’s true<br>
Wishing on a shooting star<br><br>
And before you fall in love<br>
Be sure to make sure it’s good enough<br>
Maybe some things never had to be <br>
This way<br><br>

And before you fall in love<br>
Be sure to make sure it’s good enough<br>
Maybe some things never had to be<br> 
This way<br><br>

I am falling through the sky<br>
I wonder why<br>
You are leavin’ me behind<br>
But I don’t mind<br><br>

And I don’t mind<br>
Everything’s always hard to find<br>
I do it’s true<br>
Wishing on a shooting star<br><br>

And before you fall in love<br>
Be sure to make sure it’s good enough<br>
Maybe some things never had to be <br>
This way<br><br>

And before you fall in love<br>
Be sure to make sure it’s good enough<br>
Maybe some things never had to be <br>
This way

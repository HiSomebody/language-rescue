Lyrics (Improv)<br><br>
<strong>Paul:</strong>&nbspGo home there’s no place to go <br>
You don’t even know what I know<br>
Me, my gang, we’re all in a group<br>
That’s the way we all go shoe!<br>
Me, my gang, we know where to play<br>
We go all the way today<br>
What’s the point of tellin’ it all<br>
You can just listen<br>
Here’s my beat-boxin’ skills <br>
Here’s my piano-playin’ skills<br>
Me, my gang, we all know where to go<br>
That’s the way we know where to go<br>
When we think we’ve lost it all<br>
We take it out on each other<br>
That’s the way things work around here<br>
We think we all know where to go<br>
Cuz going is nowhere to go<br>
If you’ve got no place to go<br>
Spiders are eaten by every human being<br>
Average seven times in a lifetime<br>
Me, my gang, we sleep<br>
Twice as long as everybody else<br>
We probably eat twice as many spiders <br>
As everyone else<br>
That’s because we sleep twice as long<br>
Starting Monday morning to Saturday night<br>
We get up Sunday morning to go to church<br>
We know all the things about our church<br>
Daxton doesn’t go cuz he ain’t active<br>
He still comes to our house to have fun<br>
He comes to Mutual sometimes<br>
But other times he sluffs and watches Jazz games<br>
That’s the way things work around here <br>
That’s the way we go to school<br>

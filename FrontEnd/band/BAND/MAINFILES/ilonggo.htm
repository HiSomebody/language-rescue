Acknowledgements:
I would like to thank my outstanding mission “Tatay”, Elder Clayton Max Schmoekel, to whom much of this work can be attributed.  His excitement to learn more and diligence in language study surpassed that of any missionary I’ve ever met.  It is for people like him that I have compiled such a work as this.

Preface:
The purpose of this work is to provide a missionary at any stage of experience with meaningful conversational materials to study, for the primary reason that the presently available materials for studying conversational Ilonggo are frankly, lacking.

As implied by the word “conversational”, you may safely assume we will learn shortcuts and informal (though not slang) speech.  We will learn substitutions at times rather than direct translations for the sake of being understood.  Also included are many phrases that we would rarely say in English, but are common to the culture of the Filipino.

Learning grammar rules will not be our highest priority, but we will go over some of them as appropriate and as we come across them in context.  I’m a believer that stating a grammar rule without an example of how to use the rule is useless to even the learned man.  We learn best by example, not by instruction alone.

Though learning rules helps you speak correctly, in and of itself it will not help you begin to speak.  Common phrases that have already been proven and tested will serve as training wheels of a bike and will be the best way for you to begin speaking a foreign language.

As many have said before, culture plays a huge part in language: what people tend to talk about, what they believe and in effect how they would respond to certain questions or situations.  Just be flexible as you soak it all in “amat-ámat lang” (little by little).

With a greater understanding of a culture and common phrases associated therewith, you’ll be pleasantly surprised as you’ll occasionally find yourself predicting somebody’s response to a particular question, or understanding an entire phrase or meaning just by hearing one word.

For example: If you’re an American and a Filipino asks you a question with the word “tinápay” in it, many times you can safely assume that they are asking you if all Americans eat is bread (as opposed to rice), one of the stereotypical beliefs of the Filipinos.

Or if you hear the word “ilóng” meaning “nose”, it would help you to know that most Filipinos think long noses are beautiful and that their short noses are ugly, so maybe they are complimenting you for having such a beautiful nose or maybe they’re playfully asking to trade noses with you.

How to learn a new language:
1: Memorize greetings, common phrases, and common expressions even if you don’t quite understand the grammar behind it.

2: Memorize useful common parts of speech prioritizing personal pronouns (you, me, he, they, etc.), demonstrative pronouns (this, here, there, etc.), conjunctions (and, but, or, so), yes/no, interrogatives (who, what, where, when, why, etc.)

3: When moving onto vocabulary memorization start with verbs – they are more crucial to know than nouns.  They tell you what is happening in conversation.

4: Memorize other less useful vocabulary words.  In the Philippines, most people are comfortable with using English nouns (people, places, things), verbs (go, give, take, wait, etc.), and even adjectives (small, big, heavy, ugly, etc.).  In any language nouns are almost innumerable and some are rarely used.  Memorize common nouns but don’t get too caught up in it.  Learn them as you hear them.  

Above all else I would prioritize memorizing a common way to use each word rather than just the word itself.  When you hear a new word, don’t forget what context you heard it in.  That context may be the only common way to use the word so just memorize the whole phrase while you’re at it.  

When we learned our first language we did it in phrases.  Words can have many different uses and even definitions but a phrase is virtually singular in meaning.  Society in any culture has already put together words in certain ways to mean specific things that are commonly understood.  So in conversation listen carefully and repeat things the way you hear them as appropriate.

I can tell you from experience that unless you have an exceptionally rare experience with the gift of tongues, you will not suddenly become “fluent” as many people think of it when learning their second language.  A common misconception is that you either know a language in its entirety or you don’t know it at all.  If that were true, nobody would be “fluent” in any language because there will be always things we still don’t know.

With this understanding, that a language is learned piece by piece like a puzzle that no one can ever completely finish, we may redefine fluency as the point where people can recognize the picture on the puzzle despite the fact that there are still missing pieces.

Just to illustrate my point that there are things that the Ilonggo’s don’t know about their own language, go ask an Ilonggo to count to 50 in pure Hiligaynon.  They can’t do it.

So this material is for anyone who learns best the same way I do – seeing everything applied in context and drawing my own conclusions – for anyone wanting to be told the “whys” and “hows” I have included explanatory notes and grammar rules as necessary.

The Apostle Paul spoke of feeding a baby milk before trying to feed it meat (1 Cor. 3:2) so that's what I will try to do here.  We will start with the most common, basic phrases and grammar rules, move on to the intermediate grammar and exceptions to rules on a contextual basis, and I'll try to hide the deeper, less useful things at the end.  Just about all of the phrases are taken from actual conversation and experience, so as to not teach you silly useless phrases like English's infamous "See Jane run" or also phrases that make you sound like a baby: "the ball is big".

It would do little good for you if I provided you with sample sentences that included names of nouns and subjects.  When we are truly engaged in conversation we simplify things by replacing proper nouns with personal pronouns (She, he, they, you, etc.) and ordinary nouns with demonstrative pronouns (this, that, these, those).  This is how we are able to speak our native tongue with little effort.  We have memorized how to use pronouns in every context.  Memorizing the phrase "Johnny gave me the ball" will be a waste of your internal memory while memorizing the phrase "He gave it to me" will open up thousands of doors for you.

Another important thing to know is how to use the word "it".  "It" is a very common word in English, therefore many people wonder what the translation is in the Filipino languages.  The truth is, you don't need to include any word at all.  As long as you are using object focus and no pronoun is used, the word "it" is always implied. Let me illustrate this in the most simple way possible: 

• Nagkáon sia - He ate (actor focus)
• Ginkáon nia - He ate it (object focus)
• Ginkáon nia ang keyk - He ate the cake (object focus with "ang" subject included)
• Ginkáon nia 'nâ - He ate that (object focus with demonstrative pronoun included)

• Nagbálik sia - She came back /She returned (actor focus)
• Ginbálik nia - She gave it back /She returned it (object focus)

If some of the English translations I have included sound odd, trust me the Ilonggo counterparts sound better and are well understood.  Remember we are taking "Hiligaynon" phrases and attempting to decode them into English.

Disclaimer #1: There's no way to possibly include every type of phrase in every context, but I hope that the few examples I have given along with their respective notes will instigate thought and jumpstart your knowledge and study toward understanding and using the Hiligaynon conversational language.  The user may certainly build upon and add to the material that I have included here.

Disclaimer #2: You will most likely discover new things that I've never even come across - words I've never heard and definitions I didn't understand entirely.  That's just one of the joys of learning a language that just 7 million people speak natively and varies depending upon the area - aside from the possibility that like me, you may never be assigned in a pure Hiligaynon-speaking area.

Disclaimer #3: Some few people will be so taken aback by the fact that you're a foreigner that they will underestimate your skills and not even listen to what you're saying or they will assume you don't know what you're talking about.  That's not your fault so don't be discouraged.  Just go talk to someone else who is intelligent.

Let’s start with pronunciation.  These phrases won’t mean much to people unless you stress all the right syllables and apply all of the glottal stops that are indicated by ^ and \.  For those of us from Utah, and some other places in America, a glottal stop sounds like a lazy “t”.  We see the word “feet” but many times in conversation we pronounce it as “feeh”.  That “h” sound is actually called a glottal stop and a lot of Filipino words that end in a vowel actually have a hidden glottal stop.  So when you see the word “makità” (to see something), it may be easier for you to pronounce it as though it was spelled “makitat”.

Key:    / = accent this syllable and don’t do a glottal stop
        \ = accent the second to last syllable in the word and apply a glottal stop (English example: Parrot)
        ^ = accent the last syllable in the word and apply a glottal stop (English example: Receipt)

When all else fails (or before all else if you're a wise individual), I would encourage you to ask your nearest native Hiligaynon speaker to read these out loud for you to listen carefully and mimic.  This will save you from developing bad habits that no one will ever correct you on which would leave you sounding silly every time you say words like "sagád" for the rest of your mission.


Body language:

Raise of eyebrows: Hello /yes
Brief head nod down - I don't know
Mouth open - please repeat what you just said /I couldn't hear you
Hand beckoning (downward swoop - palm facing down) - come here

Ta: the shortcut for both "kita" and "naton". In this work I have differentiated the two by putting an apostraphe before the pronoun short for "kita".
•	Ta! - (interjection) Let's go!

When "ta" is short for "kita", the actor focus pronoun, sequencially it follows all the same rules as "kita". When "ta" is short for "naton" it follows the sequential pattern of the other one-syllable pronouns (mo, ka, nia, nyo).  (It precedes "man", "gid", "na", "pa", "lang", etc.) Observe this in the following.

(Instead of saying "ko ka", or "ko kamo", you say "ta ka", and "ta kamo" respectively)
(Tagalog: "kita"; "ko kayo")

•	Palangga ta ka - I love you 
•	Palangga ta kamo - I love you (plural)
•	Palangga ta gid ka - I really love you /I love you so much (This is the only context I know of where you can put words like "man", "gid", "na", and "pa" in front of the one syllable pronoun "ka")

Other uses of "bastos"

Cultural Note: Almost every Filipino has a nickname in addition to a given name.  Many times that nickname is two syllables and is commonly shortened to just the final syllable.  Most people are better known by neighbors and friends by their nicknames.  For personal contacting purposes it is useful to know a person's nickname. Just to give you an idea of how unknown a Filipino's given name can be, I will inform you that most school yearbooks include both the given name and nickname of each individual pictured.

Particles
Aside from clarifying what you're really trying to say and imply, particles are what make your speech worth listening to.  The trouble is that rarely, if ever, can they be translated word for word.  So using the topic of "going to church" I will illustrate the main uses of particles "na", "pa", "gid", "man", "gihapon", "gali", "gani", "tani", "kono", "guro", "haw", and several combinations thereof.

Example: 
• 	Ay - Sunday gali! - Oh, you meant "Sunday"! /Oh, you said "Sunday"!

(this differs from the above statement (using "na namán") in that by using "pa gid" it is not specific whether Iloilo was your origin.  "Na namán" implies that Iloilo was your at one point your origin and will be your destination yet again.
• 	Pa gid?!! - (expression) Again?! /Not again! /You're still not satisfied?!

•	Kon ihúlog ko bi? - What if I drop it? (Maybe you're intentionally holding someone's bag precariously over a mud puddle or bridge.)

•       A: Kumusta ka?  B: Okéy lang.  Ikáw ya? – A: How are you?  B: Just fine.  What about you? (Whatever was phrased about subject A can be turned around and reused on subject B by using “ya”.

Simplifying questions by ending statements with "man", "ganì", "haw" and "ya" (very informal speech)
1. Man - you're asking a question because you're unfamiliar with something (see page   for further explanation)
Formula: [subject] + "man?"
•	Sín-o si Miguél? - Who's Miguel?
informal shortcut:
•	Miguél man?

2: Gani - you're asking a question because you're trying to remember something (see page   for further explanation)
Formula: [subject] + "gani?" 
•	Sín-o ganì ngálan niá? - What's his name again?
informal shortcut:
•	Ngálan niá ganì?

3: Haw - you're wanting an explanation "why" (see page   for further explanation)
Formula: [declarative statement] + "haw?"
•	Ngá-a ári ka di? - Why are you here?
informal shortcut:
•	Ári ka di haw? - Why are you here?

4: Ya - you're asking whatever has just been asked or making a question out of what has just been stated but applying it to a different subject (see page   )
Formula: [subject] + "ya?"
•	Ikáw ya? - And you? /What about you? /And how about you?


Common mistakes made even by seasoned missionaries - both foreigner and Pinoy alike:
1. 
Error: "kabaló mo", "kabaló nia", "kabaló níla/námon/náton/nínyo/etc."
Reason(s) for error: In Tagalog, when saying "I know..." you nearly always use object focus, thus when transferring over to Bisaya, the Tagalog Speakers tend to use object focus pronouns.
Doctrine: "kabaló" is short for "makahíbaló", a constant actor focus conjugation, therefore it must use actor focus pronouns.
Solution(s): "kabaló ka", "kabaló sia", "kabaló silá/kamí/kitá/kamó/etc." (or... in object/location focus:) "bál-an mo", "bál-an nia", "bál-an níla/námon/náton/nínyo/etc."  Think of "kabaló" as the translation for Tagalog's "marúnong" or "nakákaalám".
The same is true for other Bisayan dialects. Aklanon: "Kasáyod/Sáyran". Karay-a: "Kamáan/Mán-an".
Notice: in Cebuáno, "mo" is actually short for "kamó" rather than "nímo", so you may hear Cebuános say things like "kamáo 'mo?".

2.
Error: "Ságad" (pronounced with stress on first syllable)
Reason(s) for error: 
1) Foolish traditions of our fathers
2) When doubling the root such as in "Kasagad-ságad sa íya" the stress truly does fall upon the second to last syllable.
Doctrine: When standing alone (as in: "sagád siá") the root "sagád" has a stress on the last syllable.
Solution: Always stress the last syllable unless you double the root. "Sagád" turns into "kasagad-ságad".
Root words with the same function: dakô (kadakô-dakò), kagamó (kagamo-gámo), basâ (basâ-basà), Kagamáy (Kagamay-gámay), bahô (kabahô-bahò), liwát (liwat-líwat), balík (gabalík-bálik)

3.
Error: Indì siá nagsímba (or any other statement beginning with ["Indì" + (pronoun) + nag..."] or ["Indì" + (pronoun) + naga..."]
Reason(s) for error: This closely resembles correct grammar in Tagalog: "Hindî siya nagsimbá".
Doctrine: "Indì" is never ever used to negate a conjugation in past or present tense.  The correct words for the job are either "wa'áy" or "walâ", used interchangably.
Correct Example: "Wa'áy siá nagsímba"
Solution: When conjugating, think of "Indì" as "will not", "cannot", or "refuses to".  Think of "walâ" as "couldn't", "didn't", "doesn't", or "isn't".

4.
Error: Nalipát mo/nyo/námon/níla/etc.
Reason(s) for error: This very well looks like it is in object focus.
Doctrine: "Nalipát" is actor focus, actually the short form of: "Nagkalipát"
Solution: If you want to focus on an object, a specific thing you forgot, you must say: "Nalípatán" or "Nalíptan".

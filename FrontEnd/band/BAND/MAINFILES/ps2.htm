Lyrics (Improv)

<br>
<strong>Daxton:</strong> PS2! PS2! I’m gonna go play my PS2!
I am gonna play my PS2!
Me sit in my house on my PS2!
I’m gonna get a PS3 for Christmas! ……….
…(muffle, muffle, who knows what he’s saying? Maybe you should ask him yourself)
<br>
<strong>Daniel: (at same time)</strong> This is Daxton. He’s a little bit crazy. You might wonder why. Well, it’s because he plays PS2.  He thinks he likes it but it’s taking over him.  You don’t wanna end up like him.  So stay away from PS2.  Don’t play PS3 either.  Stay away from video games.  You’ll end up like this guy.  Thank you.

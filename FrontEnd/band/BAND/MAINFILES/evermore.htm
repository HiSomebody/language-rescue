<br>Lyrics <br><br>
<strong>Daxton:&nbsp</strong>I’m fallin’ faster now<br> 
<strong>Daniel:&nbsp</strong>The time will never come<br>
<strong>Daxton:&nbsp</strong>There’s no chance of breakin’ out<br>
<strong>Daniel:&nbsp</strong>Cuz school has just begun<br><br>
 
<strong>Paul:&nbsp</strong>If I could go back<br>
And live that summer again<br>
Then I would see the good <br>
That it would do for me<br><br>

If I could go back<br>
And live that summer again<br>
Then I could see the good <br>
That it would do for me<br><br>
Evermore<br>

<strong>Daxton:</strong>
Okay.<br>
I saw you sitting there <br>you were sitting on a furry log<br>
Now I don't know what to do with you <br>
so I did decide to come talk to you<br>
Now I don't think I know what to do so now I went to talk to you I guess I did it now.<br><br>

I started talking now I think<br>
You think that you think<br>
I didn't know what to say<br><br>

So now I got to go<br>
but now I did a bad mistake I should go back<br>

But now I did a bad mistake I should go back <br>
And talk to you<br><br>

Now I went back there <br>
And asked if you wanted to go to the movies<br>
Now I got a date <br>
So now I got to go and buy those movies<br>
Now<br><br>

<center><h2>To anyone on this site</h2></center>
<h3><p>I really don't think you came here on purpose, and if you did it was probably because you are one of our few friends.&nbsp
We do not claim to be good at singing, writing, or playing songs, and we can probably guess what you're thinking. &nbsp 
We are not even a band if you could even have imagined it so.&nbsp
We have never performed, been signed by a producer (or attempted to), or earned any money for our band from our music. &nbsp 
The reason for this site is just because I took some Beginning Web Design class, and thought it would be
fun to mess around with html. &nbsp  
We are just four good friends having a good time and doing what we like to do.  &nbsp
I think I must give credit to "Premium Beat" for the player script.&nbsp</p>
<p>I know you probably have a lot to critique about this site, us, or the world, but even if I wanted to hear it, 
I wouldn't know how to accept comments from viewers.</p>

Lyrics<br><br>
<strong>Paul:</strong>&nbspTwelve years of Thinking that I could not do<br>
<strong>Daxton:</strong>&nbspNot do<br>
<strong>Paul:</strong>&nbspThe only thing that I ever knew<br>
<strong>Daxton:</strong>&nbspEver knew<br>
<strong>Paul:</strong>&nbspLeave it to be and maybe someday<br>
<strong>Daxton:</strong>&nbspSomeday<br>
<strong>Paul:</strong>&nbspWe'll find another way<br>
<strong>Daxton:</strong>&nbspAnother way<br><br>

<strong>Paul:</strong>&nbspSince everyone's got some place to go<br>
<strong>Daxton:</strong>&nbspTo go<br>
<strong>Paul:</strong>&nbspHow could they stop to share what they know<br>
<strong>Daxton:</strong>&nbspWhat they know<br>
<strong>Paul:</strong>&nbspCould it be that I like number three<br>
<strong>Daxton:</strong>&nbspNumber three<br>
<strong>Paul:</strong>&nbspWhen will they just see me<br>
<strong>Daxton:</strong>&nbspSee me<br><br>

<strong>All:</strong>&nbspAlone in the dark With no place to start<br>
And no one believes in me<br>
Living without my Eagle Scout <br>
didn't seem like a crime to me<br>

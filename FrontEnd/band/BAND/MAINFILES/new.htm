<strong>Paul:</strong>
You got the feeling that you just gotta do<br>
Something that no one ever knew<br>
There's bridges to build
and People to meet<br>
You'll never reach the top until you just believe<br><br>

Cuz it's a bright new day<br>
And nothing's standing in your way<br>
Be all that you can be<br>
Cuz everything will be all right<br><br>

You say there's no way left for you to achieve <br>
Anything you ever had dreamed<br>
Keep it together and always remember<br>
You can be a whole lot more than anyone could believe<br><br>

Cuz it's a bright new day<br>
And nothing's standing in your way<br>
Be all that you can be<br>
Cuz everything will be all right <br>
It'll be all right a<br><br>

Bright new day<br>
And nothing's standing in your way<br>
Be all that you can be<br>
Cuz everything will be all right<br><br>

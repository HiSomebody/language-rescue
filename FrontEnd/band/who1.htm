<strong>Paul:</strong>
How can I say it<br>
You don't believe<br>
Just listen up a sec'<br> 
And please don't leave<br><br>

Don't worry what I trying to <br>
Say won't hurt you<br>
I just want you to see<br><br>

Who am I to disagree<br>
with the feeling in my heart<br>
When I knew that you were meant for me<br>
Right from the very start<br><br>

See I told you<br>
It wasn't so bad<br>
And maybe from now on<br>
you'll believe<br><br>

Cuz I just really<br><br>

<strong>Daxton:</strong>Really<br><br>

<strong>Daniel:</strong>Really<br><br>

think you're the one <br><br>

<strong>Paul:</strong>
And I just want you to see<br><br>

Who am I to disagree<br>
with the feeling in my heart<br>
When I knew that you were meant for me<br>
Right from the very start<br><br>

Who am I to disagree<br>
with the feeling in my heart<br>
When I knew that you were meant for me<br>
Right from the very start<br><br>
